# Prerequisites

Install SDK as per https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/downloads/

Note that you will need to set appropriate environments for your Atlassian SDK home, for example appropriate
variation of:

    JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_181.jdk/Contents/Home
    export JAVA_HOME
    export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
    export ATLAS_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/atlassian-plugin-sdk/6.3.10/libexec

Then check installed OK

    atlas-version

# Releases

When validating changes deploy the plugin with a SNAPSHOT release number.   When work is done, then remove the
SNAPSHOT label from the version number in the maven pom.xml, and then build and deploy to Bitbucket so that
a known version is deployed.  After release increase the version to the next SNAPSHOT version.

# Installation

Build the plugin :

    cd ifs-bitbucket-plugin
    atlas-mvn install

Then log in to Bitbucket with account with admin access and click settings gear icon -> admin -> Manage add-ons ->
Upload add-on.

# Background Reading

Here are the SDK commands you may use:

 * atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
 * atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
 * atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
