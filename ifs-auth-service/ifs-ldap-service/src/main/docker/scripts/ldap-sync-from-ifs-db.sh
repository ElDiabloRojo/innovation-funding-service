# Functionality to reset the users in ldap using the current values in the database.
# Note the following:
#
# This script is put on the ldap server as part of the docker build. The ldap server
# is only present in non named environments and so this script is only present there. 
# For named environments a similar mechanism is present with an indentically named,
# but slightly different, shell script being put on a stand alone built docker image. 
# That process could be used instead of this, but it would lengthen build times. 
#
# This script does the following:
# Wipes all users on the ldap
# Put users from the ifs db into the local ldap
# Uids are added as they are found in the database
# All users get the same password
#
# Update history:
# A Munro 10 Mar 2017 Big gotya, slapadd is intermittent with replication; sometimes it works
# and sometimes it doesn't (even with the -w arg). To be safe, need to use ldapadd.

# Args:
# $1: db host (default ifs-database)
# $2: db (database name; default ifs)
# $3: db user (default root)
# $4: db user password (default password)
# $5: db port (default 3306)
# $6: ldap password (default default)
# $7: ldap domain (default dc=nodomain)

# The infamous user password: Passw0rd
