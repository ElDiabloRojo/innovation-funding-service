Dear ${notificationTarget.name},

You have submitted your application to transfer your Horizon 2020 grant funding to UK Research and Innovation.

What happens next?

- your application will be checked to ensure eligibility for the Horizon 2020 underwrite
- we will contact you to let you know if you are eligible or not
- if you are eligible, you will move on to project setup
- you will need your EU reconciliation statement and funding conversion spreadsheet during project setup

Your EU reconciliation statement will be issued to you by the EU, so you must contact them directly for updates. Please apply for this as soon as possible.

We will aim to get back to you as soon as we can but regret that we are unable to give firm dates at this stage.

If you have any queries, please ring 0300 321 4357 or email EUGrantsFunding@ukri.org.

Yours sincerely,
