Note: currently pointing at sysint. 

## Deploying

### Local

`npm run cypress:open`  for interactive testing
`npm run  e2e` for headless running

### Openshift

not supported yet

## Applicant crawl

`crawl.js` crawls the system as `steve.smith@empire.com`  and checks for accessibility issues. 

Other tests are simple examples and shouldnt be relied upon.
